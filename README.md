# Our Approach
### Identifying the Political Left and Right

### Sentiment Analysis
The following sets of plots for each year show the distributions of compound scores for all tweets, for the left and right subsets we identified, and for the 4 types of dialogue we idenitifed. We can see that the distributions appear very similar, both between the groups for each year and across the two years.

Similarly, the following sets of plots show how the tweets' neutrality scores are distributed.

![2020 subjectivity](2020_neu_dists.png)

Visually, the distributions of both the compound and neutrality scores are similar across the different groupings. We conduct permutation testing to determine if there are statistically significant differences between distributions across the two years.

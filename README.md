### Identifying the Political Left and Right

### Sentiment Analysis
The following sets of plots for each year show the distributions of polarities for all tweets, for the left and right subsets we identified, and for the 4 types of dialogue we idenitifed. We can see that the distributions appear very similar, both between the groups for each year and across the two years.

![2020 polarity](2020_polarity_dists.png)

Similarly, the following sets of plots show how the tweets' subjectivity scores are distributed.
![2016 subjectivity](2016_subjectivity_dists.png)
![2020 subjectivity](2020_subjectivity_dists.png)

Visually, the distributions of both the polarities and subjectivities are similar across the different groupings. We conduct permutation testing to determine if there are statistically significant differences between different pairings of distributions.

# Introduction
The 2020 presidential election in the United States was polarizing for the American people, perhaps even historically so, as Americans grappled with casting their votes for Joe Biden or President Donald Trump in light of major events that took place in 2020, including the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic at the beginning of the year and the racial protests and riots sparked by the murder of George Floyd at the hands of the police in May. Happenings such as these have led the American people to regard the year 2020 as generally negative—it was common to hear statements in the media and amongst peers such as “2020 is the worst year ever” or “I just want 2020 to be over.” There is also talk amongst the media and general public that, politically, Americans are “more divided than ever,” largely in reference to conflicting opinions about Donald Trump’s controversial presidency. We are curious if there is empirical evidence of Americans’ attitudes towards politics becoming increasingly negative and polarized as suggested by these common sentiments. 

# The Data

# Our Approach
### Identifying the Political Left and Right

### Sentiment Analysis
The following sets of plots for each year show the distributions of compound scores for all tweets, for the left and right subsets we identified, and for the 4 types of dialogue we idenitifed. We can see that the distributions appear very similar, both between the groups for each year and across the two years. 
![2016 polarity](2016_compound_dists.png)

![2020 polarity](2020_compound_dists.png)

Similarly, the following sets of plots show how the tweets' neutrality scores are distributed.
![2016 subjectivity](2016_neu_dists.png)

![2020 subjectivity](2020_neu_dists.png)

Visually, the distributions of both the compound and neutrality scores are similar across the different groupings. We conduct permutation testing to determine if there are statistically significant differences between distributions across the two years.
